It is ideal for backend teams looking for:

- Multi-environment support (Dev, UAT, Prod)
- Clean separation of business logic, data access, and external integrations
- Fast builds and deployments with esbuild and AWS CDK
- Automated CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps

Designed for serious production projects, this template ensures scalability, testability, and easy maintenance.
